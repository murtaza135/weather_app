Create a weather app which does the following:

  - allow the user to search for weather information based upon 1 of 3 things:
	+ city name
	+ coordinates

  - display the following information after the user has chosen his city or coords:
	+ city name + country name
	+ coords
	+ short weather description, eg. clear, rain, snow, etc
	+ long weather description, eg. clear sky
	+ actual temperature in celcius
	+ feels like temperature in celcius
	+ humidity
	+ wind speed + direction
	+ cloudiness level
	+ mist level
	+ amount of rain in last few hours
	+ amount of snow in last few hours
	+ time at which measurement was taken (taking into account timezone)

  - information will be displayed for the last 12 hours in 3 hour separations, and should give the user the ability
    to display info for up to the last 48 hours. It should also provide weather details for the current time, 
    regardless of whether it fits into the 3 hour separations or not

  - the interface should display icons which match the corresponding weather conditions
